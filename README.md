# The Odin Project Curriculum

The Odin Project (TOP) is an open-source community for learning full-stack web development. Our mission is to provide a comprehensive curriculum to learn web development for free. We help users learn the skills and build the impressive portfolio of projects they need to get hired as a web developer.

The curriculum is divided into distinct courses, each covering the subject language in depth. Each course contains a listing of lessons interspersed with multiple projects. These projects give users the opportunity to practice what they are learning, thereby reinforcing and solidifying the theoretical knowledge learned in the lessons. Completed projects may then be included in the user's portfolio.

Lessons are structured through a combination of original written content and a compilation of carefully curated resources from the web. This is where the contributing happens!

This repo houses the curricular content used on [The Odin Project](http://theodinproject.com) website, whereas our [main TOP repo](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/theodinproject) houses the front-end and back-end code.

The TOP community can be found in our [Discord chat rooms](https://discord.gg/fbFCkYabZB).

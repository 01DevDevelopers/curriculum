### Introduction
By now, you probably have a strong grasp of the important foundational concepts of CSS, but there is a lot more that you can do with CSS to make some truly spectacular looking websites. It's time to cover those useful little css features you can use to add some shine to your projects.

There are a _lot_ of CSS properties. [A Recent CSS Tricks Article](https://css-tricks.com/how-many-css-properties-are-there/) says there are _hundreds_. Luckily, you don't have to memorize them all. The number that you actually are going to end up using on a regular basis is much smaller. This lesson is going to cover most of the items you'll end up using the most! The format of this lesson is a little different since it's essentially just a list of CSS properties. We'll give a little description of the property and then link you to some documentation where you can see all the various options available.

### Learning Outcomes
- You'll learn about a lot of useful css properties!

#### Background
You've likely already experimented with setting background colors on things, but the `background` property can do quite a bit more. The `background` property is actually a shorthand for 8 different background-related properties, all of which you can read about in the linked docs. Beyond changing background-colors, you can also specify background images, change the position and size of background images, and change how background images repeat or tile if they are too small to fill their container. It is also possible to have multiple background layers.

One thing to note is that it _is_ possible to use these properties individually, and in some cases it might be easier and more clear to do that than defaulting to the shorthand. This is in contrast to some other shorthand properties where it is almost always preferable to default to using the shorthand (flex, margin, padding etc.)

There's a lot of information in the docs on this shorthand and all the associated properties. As we've mentioned before, you do NOT need to _memorize_ the exact order and syntax of each property. It's enough to know that they exist and have a general idea of what they do.

One more note, the **Formal Syntax** section here is _crazy_. Don't let it deter you. The basic syntax is somewhat hard to define because many of the properties that make up the shorthand are optional, or can come in different places in the definition. Read the [MDN docs on `background`.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background)

#### Borders
The `border` property is another shorthand, but it is _much_ less complicated than the background shorthand.

#### box-shadow

#### Min, Max and Overflow

#### Opacity

#### Text
already covered font-size, font-weight, font-family
cover using external fonts
letter spacing, line-height, text-transform

### Introduction

At this point, you have written quite a bit of vanilla HTML and CSS, and learned many design techniques that you will continue to use as you grow as a developer. However, through your experiences, you have no doubt encountered a CSS framework or two. You may have also learned about preprocessors (aka precompilers). Both of these types of tools can make writing CSS more streamlined and less tedious.

You should be aware that at this point in your learning, both frameworks and preprocessors are options for you, but neither of them are necessary. In particular, you'll read a strong argument below AGAINST using frameworks at this point.

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lesson, you should:

- Know what a CSS framework is.
- Know some of the available frameworks.
- Know the disadvantages of using frameworks.
- Know what a preprocessor is.
- Know some of the available preprocessors.

### Frameworks Overview

Frameworks like [Bootstrap]](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [Foundation](https://get.foundation) do a lot of the heavy lifting of packaging up commonly used CSS code, even icons and interactions (like menu dropdowns), for you. They are designed to abstract away the process of coding intuitive, reusable, and responsive elements. They do this by creating these elements for you, and giving you the tools to inject styles into your HTML elements directly through class name keywords. All you have to do to use a framework is understand how it expects you to lay out your site and which classes it uses to designate its particular batch of styles.

While the two frameworks mentioned above are heavy hitters that have been around for a while, you should be aware that there are quite a few others at this point, as evidenced by all of the lists of popular frameworks on the web. Two other extremely popular frameworks are [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Bulma](https://bulma.io/). There are many more out there.

### Disadvantages of Frameworks

Frameworks are great for rapidly producing sites with interfaces that end users can easily interact with. However, once you've taken a tour through some of the more popular ones, like Bootstrap, you'll start noticing an awful lot of similarities between a lot of sites you encounter, due to similar use of frameworks. Another concern with frameworks is that too many new developers jump into learning frameworks too early in their education; the prospect of not having to keep practicing writing vanilla CSS is very tempting. As a result, these developers do not get enough CSS practice under their belts to solidify the fundamentals of that very important language.

Additionally, the process of overriding a framework's styling or debugging style issues on your page becomes very difficult if you haven't really mastered CSS fundamentals. It is imperative to understand what a framework is doing "under the hood" so you are equipped to handle these issues later (and trust us, you will).

For the reasons above, **we recommend that you continue to focus on the fundamentals of CSS as you continue through the curriculum.** This lesson is merely designed to teach you _about_ frameworks and their role.

### Preprocessors Overview

Preprocessors (aka precompilers) are languages that help you write CSS more easily. They  eliminate code repetition and provide all sorts of time-saving and code-saving features. Some of the standard preprocessors in use are [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/), [LESS](https://lesscss.org/)and [Stylus](https://stylus-lang.com/).

Some of the useful features of preprocessors include:

1. Allowing you to use variables and functions in your code.
2. Allowing you to avoid repetition in your code.
3. Use of style standards to make writing your code easier.

As you can see, preprocessors are extremely helpful tools; however, there are some potential disadvantages to using them. See the reading in the assignment for one list of disadvantages.

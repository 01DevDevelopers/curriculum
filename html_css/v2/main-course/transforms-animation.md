### Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

* Do this
* This
* Maybe this

### Transitions
Transitions enable you to define the transition between two states of an element. Different states may be defined using pseudo-classes like :hover or :active or dynamically set using JavaScript.

* Long and short hand notation (with multiple values for both)
* What happens when property value lists are different lengths (longer or shorter)
* [List of animatable CSS properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_animated_properties) Note that can change over time
* Avoid using `auto` as it can lead to unpredictable results
* Include warning about repaints and animating transforms/opacity.
  * [Stacking contexts](https://dzhavat.github.io/2021/02/18/debugging-layout-repaint-issues-triggered-by-css-transition.html) are made when certain element scenarios are in place. See [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Positioning/Understanding_z_index/The_stacking_context) for details. Basically, if an element has a transform with a value other than `none` and it's at the bottom of the stack, that will cause a "repaint" of that element and all the elements above it on the stack
  * An animation that moves an animation using something other than transform is likely to be [slow](https://web.dev/animations-guide/#layout)
  * Where possible restrict animations to opacity and transform in order to keep animations on the compositing stage of the rendering path. 
  * [CSS Triggers](https://csstriggers.com/) helps you see how a css property will affect other elements on the page if animated

### Keyframe Animations

* Cover the animation name, duration, iteration count, direction in long and short form
* Longhand values can accept multiple values separated by commas
* @keyframes then animation name
* from (0%), to (100%), and then the % in between e.g. 75% 

Example idea:
* A ball in the center of a page
* Make it orbit the center of the page? Can call it "orbit"
* Make it orbit the center in one direction, then another, infinitely...

### HTML Tables

In the past, tables were often used to create page layouts due to the lack of CSS support. Nowadays, we use them for what they were intended: tabular data!
Getting started with tables is pretty easy, you create a table with ``<table></table>`` elements and then put the elements for rows, columns, headers or anything else that's possible!

For example: 

<p class="codepen" data-height="300" data-default-tab="html,result" data-slug-hash="abyPdRK" data-editable="true" data-user="LeoKirasic" style="height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">

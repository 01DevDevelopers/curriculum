### The end of the JavaScript course! 
Completing the JavaScript course is a major milestone! Congratulations! 

However, there is still more to go. If you're following the Ruby on Rails path, you've already learned how to build a back-end, but there is one more section, Getting Hired, with excellent content on finding a developer job. 

If you're following the JavaScript path, you'll complete: 

- An Advanced HTML and CSS section
- A NodeJS section where you'll learn to build a back-end
- And finally, the Getting Hired section

At this point, you can create phenomenal and dynamic frontends. These will integrate with the back-ends The Odin Project teaches, Ruby on Rails or Node JS, plus any back-end technologies under the right circumstances! After all, you've spent time working with APIs from the front-end already!

If you find something you don't know or aren't sure about, by now you're a pro at Googling your way to an answer, looking at docs, and cruising through Stack Overflow posts. You've got all the tools you need to be a developer. And, really, the big secret is that you've been a web developer for some time already.

There's a whole world of exciting things you can learn on the front-end side: React Native to build mobile apps, D3 for data visualization, other single-page MVC front-end frameworks, etc. The best way to learn these things is through a project you want to build where you pick the most useful tool for the job.

Whichever path you're on, BUILD! Build and build and build and build (see a theme in this curriculum yet?). Use what you've learned to create great projects. Focusing on creating interesting software is the best way to drive your education.

#### Give Your Feedback

1. Before you move on to the next section, we would like your feedback [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeHcp46iWF5D7V7wPPHDeIHK0q5Nu0zXHZi46pP7ExVjULvZA/viewform?usp=sf_link).

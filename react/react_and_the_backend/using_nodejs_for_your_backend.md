### Using NodeJS for your backend

So, you've now learned a lot of juicy JavaScript, enabling you to make various components of your HTML/CSS page react to user actions and/or input. That's great! As you've seen, you can get your apps to do a lot of pretty cool things already, just using client-side JavaScript. You may have noticed, though, that there is still an important piece of the puzzle missing: unless you use [Local Storage](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2010/10/11/local-storage-and-how-to-use-it/), your app 'forgets' the user's preferences, as well as any other changes made, as soon as the page gets reloaded.

While Local Storage is great, it's not ideal: it only stores data on the computer from which the user is accessing the page. This approach does not allow for the app to 'remember' anything when the same user tries to access it again from a different device. For that, you're going to need a real backend.

### NodeJS to the rescue!

We are now ready to leave the frontend to learn all about how to store persistent data.
NodeJS is a JavaScript runtime environment which will let you build an entire backend with JavaScript. We'll learn all about it next in our [NodeJS](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/nodejs) course. With Node, we'll be able to add a bunch of cool features to our React apps like user authentication, data persistence, and more.

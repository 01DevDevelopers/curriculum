### Introduction 

Think of your favorite messaging app - Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, AOL Instant Messenger, etc. - and imagine what it would be like if you could build your own. This project will give you a chance to do just that. You'll be building a web app that allows users to send messages to each other. 

### Assignment

<div class="lesson-content__panel" markdown="1">

1. Spend some time researching the features your app will need. What will the user interface look like? What will the data model look like? What features will you need to implement? What libraries will you need to use? You don't have to go overboard with features, remember that all those big apps we mentioned earlier have entire teams of developers working on them.
1. Start building your app by implementing the core features in your backend and frontend. Users should be able to login and send messages to each other.
1. Once you have that working, you can add profile customization options, group chats, friend list, and other features. It's all up to you.
1. Deploy your app to the web and showcase it in the submissions below as well as on our Discord. We'd love to see what you've built!

#### Extra Credit

*  Users should be able to send images in chat. 
*  Users can view who's online.
